In JavaScript, the window object and the document object are fundamental components that play distinct roles in web development. Let's take a closer look at each:

Window Object:
Global Object:

The window object represents the browser window or tab. It serves as the global object for JavaScript in a browser context.
Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword become properties of the window object.
Browser and Window Properties:

The window object provides properties related to the browser and the window, such as window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, window.location, window.history, etc.
Methods like window.open(), window.close(), and window.alert() are part of the window object.
Timers and Events:

setTimeout() and setInterval() functions for executing code after a specified time interval are part of the window object.
Event-related methods, such as addEventListener() and removeEventListener(), are also part of window.
Navigation and Location:

The window.location object provides information about the current URL and allows for navigation, such as redirecting to a new URL using window.location.href.
Frames and Popups:

Manages frames and popups within a browser window using methods like window.open() and properties like window.frames.
Document Object:
Document Object Model (DOM):

The document object represents the HTML document and serves as an interface to interact with the content of a web page.
It provides methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and getElementsByTagName() to access and manipulate elements on the page.
Content Manipulation:

Allows for the creation, modification, and deletion of elements and content within the HTML document.
Methods like createElement(), appendChild(), and innerHTML facilitate content manipulation.
Events:

Manages events on the page, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses).
Provides event-related methods like addEventListener() and removeEventListener().
Forms and Input Handling:

Handles form-related operations, such as form submission and input validation.
Provides access to form elements and their properties.
Styles and Layout:

Allows for the manipulation of CSS styles and layout properties of HTML elements.
Methods like element.style and getComputedStyle() are used for style-related operations.
